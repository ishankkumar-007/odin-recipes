      <h2>Description: </h2>

      <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles (requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken)
        <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds (24 ounces) mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 pound (4 ounces) freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps:</h2>
      For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole. Here's the run-down:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Start by making the sauce</strong> with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.</strong> We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>From there, it's just an assembly job.</strong> A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong>
        </li>
      </ol>

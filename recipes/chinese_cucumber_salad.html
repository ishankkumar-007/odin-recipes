      <h2>Description: </h2>
      <em><strong>Chinese Cucumber Salad</strong></em> is a light and refreshing appetizer. 
      The crisp cucumber is mixed with plenty of garlic, 
      drizzled with an appetizing blend of soy sauce, 
      vinegar and sugar, then finished with a few drops of sesame oil. 
      The sauce is light, yet it has a distinct sour flavor with a hint of sweetness, 
      enhanced by the strong aroma of garlic.

        <li>3 cloves garlic , crushed and minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Chinkiang vinegar (or rice vinegar)</li>

      <h2>Steps:</h2>
      For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole. Here's the run-down:
      <ol>
        <li><em>Use English cucumbers</em>
            <ul>
                <li>English cucumbers have a thinner skin and crispier texture. They work so much better in this salad than the dark-skinned American cucumbers. The smaller cucumbers (usually for making Japanese dishes and/or pickling) also work well.</li>
                <li><strong>If you use the American cucumber that has waxy and thick skin, do peel the skin before making the salad.</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><em>Smash the cucumber before cutting</em>
            <ul>
                <li>The secret to making delicious cucumber salad is to give the cucumber a coarse texture so it holds more sauce. Instead of chopping the cucumber, smash it with a cleaver first.</li>
                <li>Then tilt the cleaver to cut the cucumber into diamond-shaped pieces.</li>
            </ul>   
        </li>
        <li><em>Use Chinkiang vinegar</em>
            <ul>
                <li>Chinkiang vinegar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhenjiang_vinegar">(Zhenjiang vinegar)</a> is a type of Chinese black vinegar. It is made from various grains and is aged until the color turns dark brown or inky black. It has a rich, pungent, and tart flavor, sometimes with a hint of sweetness. It has a fermented malty taste and woody character that distinguishes it from the light-colored and fruity rice vinegar.</li>
                <li>It's a key ingredient in this recipe that gives the sauce an extra tangy and rich taste.</li>
            </ul> 
        </li>
        <li><em>A bit of chili oil goes a long way</em>
            <ul>
                <li>I love to drizzle a bit of homemade chili oil onto my cucumber salad. It adds a nice smoky aroma to the dish and really enhances its taste.</li>
                <li>If you happen to have a jar of Lao Gan Ma Chili Crisp, that's even better! It is a famous (and extremely popular) Chinese brand that sells their chili oil that's filled with crispy onion, chili peppers, and garlic. It's not the healthiest ingredient, but it will make your salad addictively tasty.</li>
            </ul> 
        </li>
    </ol>
